## Features

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- A package manager of your choice, here `pnpm` was used (I would recommend using `npm`, good ol reliable)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RemKiovo/vrchat-redesign.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd vrchat-redesign
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready files.
